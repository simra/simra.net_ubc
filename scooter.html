    <h3>RIP Scooter 1996-2003</h3>  
    <p>Scooter was my parents' cat.  They received him as
    a kitten at Christmas 1996, the same time I received my nice new 35mm
    camera- hence this picture of Scooter, with the opened xmas wrappings
    behind him.  He was a great, playful cat and loved to roam in the ravine
    out behind my parents' house.  Last week Scooter became very ill and the
    vet confirmed that he had a large tumor on his liver.  He was only six,
    in the prime of his life by cat standards.  We're all sad to see him go.
