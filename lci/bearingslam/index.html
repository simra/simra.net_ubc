<p>
    Bearings-only simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a particularly
    challenging problem for autonomous mobile robots.  The typical approach is
    to apply the extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to linearize the relationship
    between robot pose and landmark observations, send the robot off on its
    merry way and sit back and pray that the filter doesn't diverge due to the
    highly non-linear observation function.
<p>
This work approaches the problem of bearings-only SLAM by taking exploratory
trajectories that optimize the stability of the measurement update while
maximizing coverage of the unexplored space.  These movies demonstrate that the
robot can successfully map an unknown environment using an appropriate
trajectory, even in the presence of significant observation noise (up to 10
degrees standard-deviation, normally distributed noise).
    <p>
The exploratory trajectories are as follows:
<ul><li> Straight:  The robot takes a straight-line path to successive
landmarks.  A very bad strategy.
<li> Random: The robot follows a random trajectory.  The map converges, but the
robot fails to explore unknown space.
<li> Spiral: The robot follows a spiral-like path to each successive landmark,
attempting to encircle it and thereby localizing it with high accuracy.  When
every landmark has been visited, the robot returns to the start and refines the
map by continuing to visit each landmark successively.  
</ul>
<p>
In all of these runs, the robot has a field of view of 500m.  The width of the
environment is 2000m.  The ground-truth landmarks and robot pose are in blue,
the estimated landmarks are in red and the robot's estimated trajectory is
yellow.  Ignore the wide sweeping red arcs, which correspond to uncertainties
associated with undiscovered landmarks (these are distributed at random
throughout the environment to drive exploration). Check back here in the
future for images that have better contrast.

<h3>Discussion</h3>
The jaggedness of the trajectories, particularly in the high-noise case
 reflects the highly unstable localization estimate.  Despite this fact, in the
 spiral case, the robot is able to successfully navigate to each landmark in
 the environment.  It should be noted that mapping accuracy can only be
 measured relative to a global translation and rotation of the estimated map--
 hence the reason why the spiral map in the noisy case is 'correct' but offset
 from the true landmark positions. Notice that the 'Straight' strategy diverges
 almost immediately.
<p>
Note that not only does the spiral-based approach successfully converge, but it
also successfully closes the loop, a notoriously difficult problem in SLAM.
<p>
This results have important implications for a variety of exploratory
applications, and in particular vision-based SLAM, where range cannot be
directly observed.  Clearly, in real-world applications there are a slew of
other issues: imperfect data association, the presence of obstacles, etc.
However, these results demonstrate that it is valuable (and important) for an
exploring robot to collect observations in a principled manner.
