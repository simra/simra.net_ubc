<H1>Configuring Remote Printing @cs.ubc.ca</h1>

<h2>Intro</h2>

Wouldn't it be nice if you could print your documents to cc108 directly from
linux running on your laptop?  Here's how..

<h2>Overview</h2>

The basic idea is to forward the lpd port running on
<tt>hobgoblin.cs.ubc.ca</tt> to your local box and fool the local print system
into using it as a local lpd server.  I've got CUPS installed on my laptop, so
this document explains how to configure cups.  If you've just got lpd/lpr I
would imagine that this whole process is infinitely simpler..


<h2>Port forwarding</h2>

I'll assume your laptop is connected via ubc wireless.  Like smtp and imap, the
print server is firewalled, so you need to do some port forwarding magic to
make things work. 
<p>
<b>Correction:</b> Hobgoblin *isn't* firewalled, at least from
wireless.ubc.ca.  All the same, I would recommend doing the port forwarding so
that your print job can't be sniffed in transit.

<p>
First, make sure lpd is not running on your machine:
<pre>
service lpd stop
chkconfig lpd off
</pre>
Now, establish a connection to <tt>hobgoblin</tt>, the server running cc108.  (Other
printers are on <tt>printhost</tt>.  If you want to set up connections to
both hosts you'll need to use a different port..)
<pre>
ssh -N -L 515:hobgoblin.cs.ubc.ca:515 username@cascade.cs.ubc.ca &
</pre>

Note that you'll need to be root on your laptop to forward to port 515.
Otherwise, use something like <tt>5515:hobgoblin.cs.ubc.ca:515</tt>.  Also note that
you'll need to substitute your username, and also have ssh configured to
authenticate using public key authentication (see <tt>man ssh</tt> or
<tt>man ssh-keygen</tt>).  I've put this line at the end of
<tt>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</tt>
<p>
<b>A word about security:</b>  Never forward ports over a firewall without
first firewalling your laptop.  Make sure you use iptables or ipchains to
prevent third parties from exploiting your machine as an open relay.

<h2>Cups configuration</h2>

    Make sure you have cups installed (<a
    href="http://www.cups.org">http://www.cups.org</a>).  
<pre>
service cups start
chkconfig cups on
</pre>

Now we configure cc108.  If you want to configure a different printer, you can get
its information from <tt>/cs/local/generic/lib/LPRng/printcap</tt>.  Note
that most other printers are on <tt>printhost</tt>.  I'll leave <tt>cc108-onesided</tt> to future
work.. :-)
<p>
Using your browser, point to <a
href="http://localhost:631/admin">http://localhost:631/admin</a> (bet you
didn't know you were running a mini-webserver.)  
<table>
<tr><td>
<a href="cups1.png"><img src="cups1-sm.png" align=left style="margin:10px" border=0></a>
Select "Add printer" from the menu.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<a href="cups2.png"><img src="cups2-sm.png" align=left style="margin:10px" border=0></a>
Give the printer a name.  For convenience I recommend giving it the same name
as it has in the printcap.  The Location and Description boxes are only for
convenience-- write whatever you want there.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<a href="cups3.png"><img src="cups3-sm.png" align=left style="margin:10px" border=0></a>
Select LPD/LPR Host or Printer for the device.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<a href="cups4.png"><img src="cups4-sm.png" align=left style="margin:10px" border=0></a>
Enter <pre>'lpd://localhost/cc108'</pre> for the device URI.  Substitute the
actual print queue name you want to use if you're not configuring cc108.  If
you're not port forwarding, use the actual print host,
<tt>hobgoblin.cs.ubc.ca</tt> or <tt>printhost.cs.ubc.ca</tt> as the case may be.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<a href="cups5.png"><img src="cups5-sm.png" align=left style="margin:10px" border=0></a>
Select HP for the Model.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<a href="cups6.png"><img src="cups6-sm.png" align=left style="margin:10px" border=0></a>
Select HP Laserjet 4Si/4SiMX PS (xx) for the printer driver, assuming cc108.
Use the printcap for other queues.  Someone correct
me if this is incorrect.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<a href="cups7.png"><img src="cups7-sm.png" align=left style="margin:10px" border=0></a>
You're done!
</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Testing</h2>

Now try printing with <tt>'lpr -Pcc108'</tt>, or look at the queue with <tt>'lpq -Pcc108'</tt>.
You can <tt>'setenv PRINTER cc108'</tt> or <tt>'export PRINTER=cc108'</tt> to make that the
default printer.  If you have problems, please mail me and we can update this
document.  Happy printing!
