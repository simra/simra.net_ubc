<P>
An important problem which is considered in this thesis is that of
exploiting a model of visual attention in order to extract features
which are not domain dependent.  While this thesis is not concerned
with developing a model for biological visual attention <em>per se</em>,
we look to human psychophysics in order to motivate our particular
approach to robust and efficient feature extraction.
<P>
As we have previously noted, we extract landmarks on the basis of
local maxima of edge density.  Work on human visual attention
suggests that a key attribute of the loci of attention is that they
are different from their surrounding
context&nbsp;[<A HREF="node50.html#Koch1985">30</A>, <A HREF="node50.html#Schneider1977">51</A>, <A HREF="node50.html#Tsotsos1995">58</A>].  Several featural
dimensions have been identified that lead to pre-attentive ``pop-out''
and, presumably, serve to drive short-term
attention&nbsp;[<A HREF="node50.html#Triesman1982">57</A>]. Probable feature maps used by human
attention may include those for colour, edge density, or edge
orientation.  Other research demonstrates that attentional processing
is characterised by visual saccades to areas of high curvature, or
sharp angles&nbsp;[<A HREF="node50.html#Noton1971">45</A>]. Work by Dudek and Bourque
demonstrates that the behaviour of an edge-density attention operator
on simple stimuli resembles that predicted by the psychophysical
literature&nbsp;[<A HREF="node50.html#Bourque1998">12</A>], and is the basis for the operator
employed in this work.
<P>
The next chapter will expand further on the idea of employing
statistical extrema for feature extraction. We will present a formal
definition for our attention operator, and further motivate our
approach over traditional approaches to feature extraction.
