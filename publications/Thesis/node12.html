Triangulation methods for robot localisation are based on traditional
methods in cartography and navigation, which use the angles or
<em>bearings</em> measured between the lines of sight to known landmarks
in the environment.  There is a long history of research on these
methods in the domains of cartography, surveying, photogrammetry and
computational geometry.  Triangulation approaches in the domain of
mobile robotics rarely involve real-world implementation, allowing the
researcher to ignore the problems of landmark detection and
recognition, which are often issues that are domain- and
sensor-dependent.

It is apparent that given only the angle measured between two
distinguishable landmarks, the pose of the observer is constrained to
the arc of a circle, as shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node12.html#circlesa">2.1(a)</A>.  In the case
where there are three landmarks, the pose is constrained to a single
point, lying at the intersection of two circles
(Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node12.html#circlesb">2.1(b)</A>), provided that no two landmarks are
coincident.  When there are four or more landmarks, the system is
overdetermined, or may have no
solution&nbsp;[<A HREF="node50.html#sugihara88:location">54</A>, <A HREF="node50.html#Krotkov:89">33</A>]. This result provides a
basis for several localisation solutions under a variety of
conditions.  For instance, Sugihara provides a consideration of the
problem of localisation when the observed landmarks are
indistinguishable&nbsp;[<A HREF="node50.html#sugihara88:location">54</A>]. That work seeks out a
computationally efficient method for finding a consistent
correspondence between detected landmarks and points in a map. This
correspondence method is improved upon by Avis and Imai&nbsp;[<A HREF="node50.html#avis90">2</A>].
Both of these works rely heavily on the reliable extraction of
landmarks from sensor data and the accuracy of the bearing
measurements - only minor consideration is given to the problem of
using uncertain bearings.
<P>
Sutherland and Thompson approach triangulation methods from the
perspective that the landmark correspondence problem has been solved,
but the bearings to observed landmarks cannot be precisely
known&nbsp;[<A HREF="node50.html#sutherland93">55</A>].  It is shown that informed selection of
the set of landmarks to be used in the map can help to minimise the
<em>area of uncertainty</em>, that is, the area in which the robot may
self-locate for any given error range in visual angle measure.
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node12.html#rings">2.2</A> shows the area of uncertainty computed for a
bounded error range in the cases of a) two and b) three observed
landmarks.  Sutherland and Thompson demonstrate that the size of the
area of uncertainty can vary significantly for different
configurations of landmarks.  The goal of their work is to select
landmarks whose configurations minimise the area of uncertainty.

Betke and Gurvits have also considered the problem of localisation
from uncertain bearings.  They are concerned primarily with the
efficient computation of a position estimate from an overdetermined
set of bearings&nbsp;[<A HREF="node50.html#Betke1997">8</A>].  They derive a complex-domain
representation of the positions of the landmarks that linearises the
relationship between the constraining equations and allows the system
to be solved in time linear in the number of landmarks, provided that
certain constraints on the formation of the landmarks are met.
<P>
All of the triangulation methods considered here make a strict set of
assumptions about the environment and the robot.  In every case, the
robot is provided with an accurate <em>a priori</em> map of the
positions of known landmarks, and in some cases assumes the ability to
uniquely distinguish between the observed landmarks. In addition, the
robot can always reliably detect landmarks in the sensor data.  An
important aspect of these solutions is the observation that sensor
measurements are not always accurate, and hence it is most reasonable
to seek out a solution which minimises the uncertainty of the position
estimate.
