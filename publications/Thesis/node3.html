<P>
This thesis would not have been possible without the support and
encouragement of a cast of wonderful people.  Thanks are especially
in order to my research supervisor, Professor Gregory Dudek, who
patiently guided my research through more than a few difficult
hurdles, whose enthusiasm for the research was an inspiration, and
whose assistance and support has gone far beyond the 
call of duty both inside and outside the research lab.
<P>
I would also like to thank my extended family at the Centre for
Intelligent Machines, including in particular Marc Bolduc, Paul
Mackenzie and Thierry Baron for software and hardware support; Nick
Roy, Michael Daum, Eric Bourque and Scott Burlington for creative
stimulation and camaraderie; Ornella Cavalliere for administrative
support; and finally Professor Martin Levine, for his support and
guidance, and for hiring me in the first place.
<P>
The first translation of the Abstract into French was done by
Christian Ghajarian, and extensively corrected by Fran&#231;ois B&#233;lair.
Funding for my research was provided by National Science and
Engineering Research Council in the form of a postgraduate
scholarship.
<P>
Finally, I'd like to thank my family for their love and support, and
for giving me the freedom and encouragement to explore my interests.
<P>
This thesis is dedicated to Nisha, for believing in me.
