This thesis presented a method for estimating the position of a mobile
robot, without an <em>a priori</em> estimate.  This is accomplished by
learning a set of visual features, known as <em>landmarks</em>,
candidates for which are detected as local maxima of a measure of
distinctiveness.  Specifically, edge density is employed as the
measure of distinctiveness.  Landmark candidates are then grouped into
<em>tracked landmarks</em>: sets of candidates which correspond to the
same visual region of the environment, as observed from different
viewpoints.  Grouping is achieved by matching subspace encodings of
the candidates, perhaps with adjustments in position in the image in
order to improve matching.  Online position estimation is performed by
detecting candidates and matching them to the tracked landmarks.  Each
match is used to generate a pose estimate by employing a principal
components reconstruction of a feature vector which encodes both
appearance and image geometry.  The experimental results indicate that
the method is robust for a variety of environments and
parameterisations and shows promise for a range of applications.
