In order for a mobile robot to perform its assigned tasks, it often
requires a representation of its environment, a knowledge of how to
navigate in its environment, and a method for determining its position
in the environment.  These problems have been characterised by the
three fundamental questions of mobile robotics, that is ``Where am
I?'', ``Where am I going?'' and ``How can I get there?''.  This thesis
is concerned principally with a method for answering the first
question, that of position estimation, which is commonly referred to
as <em>localisation</em>.
<P>
A naive approach to robot localisation is to use odometers or
accelerometers to measure the displacements of the robot. This
approach, known as <em>dead reckoning</em>, is subject to errors due to
external factors beyond the robot's control, such as wheel slippage,
or collisions.  More importantly, dead reckoning errors increase
without bound unless the robot employs sensor feedback in order to
recalibrate its position estimate.
<P>
A key issue in developing a solution to the localisation problem is
that of domain dependence.  The majority of localisation methods are
constructed based on explicit and/or implicit assumptions about the
environment&nbsp;[<A HREF="node50.html#Leonard:91">36</A>].  In the context of machine vision, for
example, many techniques extract domain-dependent features from the
image, such as straight lines or corners - features which may not be
present or stable outside of structured office or industrial
environments.  Hence, a goal of the method presented here is to
achieve <em>domain independence</em>.  We achieve this goal by
<em>learning</em> the features or <em>landmarks</em> which are useful for
the particular domain under consideration.  While moving to a new
domain will always require retraining (that is, exploration), the
methods presented here are general in the sense that the same off-line
training and on-line estimation methods can be employed in a new
domain with little or no
alteration.
<P>
In addition to domain dependence, solutions to the problem of robot
localisation are necessarily <em>sensor-dependent</em>.  For example, a
wide range of solutions have been proposed which use sonar sensor
data. Given the sparse two-dimensional information that a sonar sensor
provides, these particular solutions are unlikely to be easily
applicable to the dense three dimensional image data obtained from a
laser range-finder or stereo cameras.  Furthermore, the geometric
interpretation of two- or three- dimensional range data obtained from
sonar, stereo cameras, or laser range-finders is subject to
instabilities and issues of non-invertibility.  In
addition, each sensor has its own set of strengths and limitations.
Sonar sensors are inherently noisy, whereas laser range-finders and
stereo cameras can be prohibitively expensive or difficult to
calibrate. For all of these reasons, we have chosen to use a single
digital camera for localisation.  The camera is a sensor which is at
once inexpensive, and provides large quantities of data at low
computational cost, possessing relatively a low signal-to-noise ratio.
