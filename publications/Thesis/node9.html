The recent success of the Mars Pathfinder mission demonstrates that
semi-auto-nomous robotic systems are within reach.  A robust and
scalable solution to the localisation problem will be central to
achieving the goal of complete autonomy.  The Pathfinder mission is
only one example of a wide variety of application domains for this
work.  Clearly, the development of autonomous robots will be a
significant factor in many domains of exploration, wherever working
conditions may present an environment which is hostile to life, or out
of the reach of human travel. Examples of such environments include
outer space, the depths of the oceans, geothermal hotspots,
radioactive or contaminated sites or other extreme environments.
Autonomous robots are already in use in automated delivery systems in
some hospitals and warehouses and someday we might expect that an
autonomous robot will be an integral part of every household: mowing
the lawn, vacuuming, or simply tidying up. One significant aspect of
realising this goal is that of constructing solutions which are at
once practical, efficient and cost-effective. We believe that the work
presented here is a step in this direction.
