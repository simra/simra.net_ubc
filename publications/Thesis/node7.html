The problem that we wish to solve is that of obtaining a pose estimate
for a robot located in a previously explored region of the
environment.  The robot is equipped with a single achromatic
(grey scale) camera, and does not require an <em>a priori</em> estimate
of its position.  An accurate position estimate is desired without any
motion on the part of the robot. One might imagine that the robot must
consistently re-localise itself after periodic shutdowns for
maintenance.  We are also searching for a solution which is scalable,
both in terms of the size of the environment, and the sampling density
of the prior exploration, as well as robust to variations in lighting
conditions.  Finally, we are seeking a solution which permits
<em>accuracy</em> to an arbitrary precision.  We will evaluate the
accuracy of a particular set of results with respect to the sampling
density of the prior exploration, under the understanding that
increased precision can be obtained by increasing the sampling
density.  The validity of this assumption will also be considered.  In
this thesis, we are concerned principally with experimental results.
Theoretical issues are addressed with respect to their relevance to
the method, and complexity issues are addressed in terms of both the
computational and travel time required for exploration and subsequent
position estimation.  The accuracy of the results are considered under
variations in environmental conditions in a variety of domains.
