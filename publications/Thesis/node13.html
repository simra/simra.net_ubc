Few of the methods presented thus far take into consideration the
possibility of combining multiple observations of the environment.
That is, the robot may wish to consider integrating data from multiple
sensors, data acquired over time, or even previous pose estimates in
its computation of the current pose.  The most popular technique for
achieving this goal is Kalman filtering.  Kalman filtering has been
used in a variety of application domains for computing estimates from
uncertain data acquired over time.  In the context of mobile robotics,
Self, Smith and Cheeseman derive a method for combining uncertain
reference frames (known as <em>Approximate Transforms</em> or ATs) using
a Kalman filter&nbsp;[<A HREF="node50.html#smith1987">52</A>, <A HREF="node50.html#smith1986">53</A>].  ATs are represented
mathematically by a mean estimate and associated covariance matrix and
represent transformations between reference frames such as that
between a robot's internal representation of the environment and a
global reference frame.

Leonard and Durrant-Whyte have applied the Extended Kalman Filter
(EKF) to the problem of localisation using sonar data which is
obtained over time&nbsp;[<A HREF="node50.html#Leonard:91">36</A>].  Like the Kalman Filter, EKF
methods allow for the integration of multiple sources of data and
allows prior data to be weighted according to how well it predicts the
current observations.  Leonard <em>et al</em>. apply the EKF to sonar
data which has been preprocessed into <em>geometric beacons</em>, which
are employed as landmarks. As these landmarks are indistinguishable,
the robot relies heavily on a good <em>a priori</em> estimate in order
to obtain an accurate position estimate.
<P>
Extended Kalman filtering techniques have been used in a variety of robotic tasks such as
road-following, visual map-building and egomotion estimation and other
related navigational applications such as ship navigation and missile
tracking&nbsp;[<A HREF="node50.html#Dickmanns:88">18</A>, <A HREF="node50.html#ayache:maintain">3</A>, <A HREF="node50.html#Kriegman:etal:89">32</A>, <A HREF="node50.html#Matthies:Shafer:87">43</A>, <A HREF="node50.html#sorenson83:automatic">24</A>].
One significant disadvantage of both the Kalman filter and the EKF is
that they make a <em>locally linear</em> approximation to the true
relationship between position and observations.  That is, the Kalman
filtering techniques tend to rely on a good <em>a priori</em> estimate.
For this reason Kalman filtering methods can suffer from lack of
robustness or failure to converge altogether.

Several researchers have proposed alternative methods for approaching
the task of optimising the correspondence between sensor measurements
and a known map.  Beveridge, Weiss and Riseman, and Lu and Milios
propose solutions which seek out an optimal registration of sensor
data in the least squares
sense&nbsp;[<A HREF="node50.html#beveridge:optimization">9</A>, <A HREF="node50.html#cvpr94*935">39</A>].  The solution proposed
by Beveridge and colleagues uses an iterative match-and-perturb
technique to arrive at a locally optimal correspondence, whereas Lu
and Milios seek out an estimate which results in globally optimal
sensor data registration.  Similarly, Boley, Steinmetz and Sutherland
employ a method which computes a least-squares position estimate from
all the data that is available to it, and supports real-time
implementation by deriving a recursive method to incorporate new
measurements incrementally&nbsp;[<A HREF="node50.html#boley96">11</A>].  These works tend to depend
critically on the availability of good range data and limited input
error. In other work, Thrun derives a Bayesian probabilistic solution
to the localisation problem which subsumes the Kalman
filter&nbsp;[<A HREF="node50.html#Thrun1998">56</A>].  In that work, the computational
intractability of the derived probabilities leads to a neural-network
based implementation.
<P>
While most optimisation approaches seek out a least-squares optimum in
the correspondence error, several other measures have been suggested,
such as the generalised Hough transform, geometric
hashing and the Hausdorff
distance&nbsp;[<A HREF="node50.html#Carlsson1994">15</A>, <A HREF="node50.html#prassler98">49</A>, <A HREF="node50.html#lamdan-geometric-hashing-iccv-88">35</A>, <A HREF="node50.html#CORNELLCS//TR92-1321">28</A>, <A HREF="node50.html#lin97:mobile">37</A>].
