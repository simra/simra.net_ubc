The dependence of the method on reliable visual tracking cannot be
understated.  During the research, a good deal of attention was paid
to obtaining tracked landmarks which were free of outliers, and yet
covered as many instances of the same visual features as possible.
Achieving success in larger environments, and with lower sampling
densities, will depend to a large extent, on how well tracked
landmarks characterise the underlying visual features.  Furthermore,
the computational complexity of the current method is such that it is
the most time-consuming aspect of the method.  Indeed, this was one of
the most challenging aspects of the research.  Future work would include proposing
alternative methods for tracking the landmark candidates.  This would
include methods for selecting appropriate thresholds and perhaps also
incorporate reconstruction error, which was not considered in this
context.
