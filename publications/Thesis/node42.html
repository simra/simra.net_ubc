A principle contribution of this research is the further advancement
of a model of visual attention that exploits distinctiveness as a
criterion for visual interest. The advantage of this model is that it
precludes any explicit or implicit domain-dependent assumptions about
landmarks.  Based on this model, we developed a formal definition of a
landmark and formulated and implemented a method for their extraction.
The extraction method was shown to be fast and reliable.
<P>
In order to characterise the variation in appearance and image
geometry of landmarks, we proposed a method for <em>visual tracking</em>
which matches landmarks based on appearance and applies
no assumptions or constraints on real-world geometry, or on the pose
of the camera.  Note that while our experiments were all conducted at a
fixed orientation, this was performed in order to constrain the
<em>dimensionality</em> of the configuration-space, as opposed to its
geometry.  The tracking method proved robust in a variety of scenes,
only demonstrating minor degradation as the sample spacing grew larger,
mostly due to aspects of self-similarity, and large changes in view
from one viewpoint to its nearest neighbour.
