Localisation methods which operate on the basis of geometric
reasoning rely on the reliable extraction and recognition of
<em>features</em> from sensor data. Image-based methods extract features
based on edge formations, such as corners or straight
lines&nbsp;[<A HREF="node50.html#Zoghlami1997">64</A>, <A HREF="node50.html#Krotkov:89">33</A>, <A HREF="node50.html#sugihara88:location">54</A>, <A HREF="node50.html#kosaka:fast">31</A>],
or perform segmentation on the basis of intensity or
colour&nbsp;[<A HREF="node50.html#tsubouchi:mapassisted">59</A>], while sonar-based methods attempt
to link sonar points into lines and
structures&nbsp;[<A HREF="node50.html#Leonard:91">36</A>, <A HREF="node50.html#mackenzie:icra">40</A>].  Feature
extraction and correspondence is plagued by the inherent
noise of almost all sensors, which often leads to
instability in the extracted features.  For most feature-based
methods, the choice of which features to employ is often sensor
dependent and constrained to a particular application domain.  For
example, Sugihara, Krotkov, Yagi <em>et al</em>. and Kosaka and Kak all
present methods which depend on the reliable extraction of vertical
lines in an image.  Vertical lines are chosen under the assumption
that if the camera pose is constrained such that it is vertically
aligned at all times, vertical structures in the environment will
always appear as vertical lines in the
image&nbsp;[<A HREF="node50.html#Krotkov:89">33</A>, <A HREF="node50.html#sugihara88:location">54</A>, <A HREF="node50.html#bb16034">62</A>, <A HREF="node50.html#bb8627">63</A>, <A HREF="node50.html#kosaka:fast">31</A>].
These assumptions break down easily if a camera is poorly mounted, the
terrain is rough, or there is a paucity of fixed vertical structures
in the environment, such as in outdoor scenes.
<P>
Feature-based methods are concerned primarily with optimising feature
correspondence, and are susceptible to local minima in the functional
to be optimised, especially when employed with large-scale
maps. Furthermore, these methods often rely on an accurate <em>a
priori</em> map which is usually obtained from architectural drawings, or
by manual measurement, which can fail to account for the presence of
furnishings such as desks or chairs, or the issues of the dynamics of
human and robot interaction with the environment.
<P>
A popular alternative to extracting naturally occurring features from
sensor data is to employ <em>artificial</em> landmarks, that is,
features which are not natural to a particular environment, but which
are inserted, affixed, or otherwise deployed on the basis that they
can be more robustly detected and extracted by a sensor. Artificial
landmarks benefit from the ability to easily extract parameters based
on <em>a priori</em> knowledge of landmark geometry, or through explicit
labelling, such as bar codes or ultrasonic
beacons&nbsp;[<A HREF="node50.html#lin97:mobile">37</A>, <A HREF="node50.html#brady87:progress">22</A>]. The use of artificial
landmarks can greatly simplify the problem of position estimation but
there are significant drawbacks in the facts that they require
prior (and often human) intervention, and can impose other costly or
impractical requirements on the environment.
